                <p><b>1.3. LOCATION DATA</b></p>
                <p>When using the Service, you must provide your location, which we store on our servers. You choose your location by means of Google Location services and your web browser or mobile device. For a description of data collected and used by them, please see their privacy policies. You may also choose to share your location. In doing so, other functionalities become available. This will, for instance, enable you to see the distance between yourself and other Users. Like on other websites and apps, revealing your location is not without risk. Sharing your location can reveal intimate information about yourself and your activities. Because of these risks, Gayte gives you the option of choosing if a location is shared or not.</p>
                <p>Please be aware, if you activate your mobile position which is automatically tracked by GPS, your location will always be shared. By doing this you may be giving others an intimate overview of your habits and patterns. This could include sensitive data such as: visits to hospitals, places of worship, presence at political demonstrations or presence at locations that might reveal information about your sex life. Revealing your location could also increase your risk of burglary, physical aggression, and stalking.</p>

                <p><b>1.4. AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED INFORMATION</b></p>
                <p>Like most other websites and apps, Gayte gathers and processes automatically generated Information about how you use our Service. This also occurs if you visit our website without logging in to an Account. The information gathered includes among other things your IP-address or the identifier of your device, your browser type and the display resolution of your computer screen or mobile device. This kind of information helps us to better understand how our Service is used, to facilitate its usability, and how we can improve it to suit the needs of our Users.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>1.5. DATA COLLECTED VIA CLOUDFLARE TURNSTILE</b></p>
                <p>Cloudflare Turnstile is implemented to distinguish between human users and automated bots. When you interact with our website, Turnstile may collect certain technical signals ("Signals"), which can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                    <li>TLS fingerprint</li>
                    <li>User-Agent string</li>
                    <li>Sitekey and associated origin</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Cloudflare collects these Signals exclusively to detect and block bots. Turnstile is designed to process the minimum data necessary and does not directly identify individuals from the information collected. The data is used for immediate security purposes as well as for improving bot detection mechanisms, in compliance with data privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA. Cloudflare acts as our data processor for security functionalities and as a data controller to enhance its bot detection algorithms.</p>

                <br>
                <p><b>2. COOKIES</b></p>
                <p><b>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</b></p>
                <p>Like most other websites and apps, Gayte uses cookies. A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website's server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Please see <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/">https://allaboutcookies.org/</a> for additional information about cookies.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>2.1. COOKIES USED BY GAYTE:</b></p>
                <p><b>Essential functional cookies</b>, Gayte uses essential functional cookies that are strictly necessary for the functioning of the Website and for the provision of services explicitly requested by you, the User. These cookies are used for services such as keeping you logged in to the Website, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your username, settings/preferences and other input. They also generally improve your experience of our Service.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Cookies for effectivity and analytics</b>, Gayte uses cookies to get information about the quality or effectiveness of its Website through the use of Google Analytics for gayteapp.com and its related subpages. These are so-called "third party analytics cookies", through which we get information about how users interact with these pages. The use of these cookies is strictly limited to Gayte's aggregated statistical purposes.</p>
                <p>Google's privacy policy applies to the way they collect, use and disclose your information. You may review it at:</p>

                <br>

                <p>You can set your web browser to only accept cookies with your consent. For more information, please consult your browser's manual. Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit.</p>
                <p>Most cookies have an expiration date. This means that they will automatically expire after a certain period and no longer register any data concerning your visit of the Gayte website. Another option is to remove the cookies manually before the expiration date. In order to do this, consult your browser's manual.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>4. SIGNALS</b></p>
                <p>At this time, we do not respond to "do not track" Signals sent from Web browsers or other mechanisms that provide users the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about a user's online activities over time and across service provider, third party and/or other party Internet services. Devices provide the ability for users to enable a "do not track" setting that disables your advertising identifier. If the "do not track" setting is disabled, we can record when a user installs the Service, and whether or not this action was the result of a tap on an ad outside of such Service. We can also run advertising on other websites, applications and services via our advertising display partners. For users who have enabled the "do not track" setting on their device, this data will not be collected. Please note that the "do not track" setting may not be available on all operating systems or versions of the Service.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Gayte may provide "aggregated anonymous data" about the usage of the Service to third parties for such purposes as it deems to be appropriate.

                <br>
                <p><b>8. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</b></p>
                <p>The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to and stored in the United States of America and other countries. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from E.U. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal data, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the U.S. or any other country in which Gayte or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities, and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. Gayte will take reasonable measures to help protect your personal data in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction and to treat it in accordance with this Policy.</p>
                <p>When we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries whose data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental bodies, we typically rely on what are called standard contract clauses. These standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>9. SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
                <p>The security of your data and that of other Users is very important to Gayte. We have implemented technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Data against loss or any form of unlawful processing. Gayte stores Personal Data on servers with limited access. These servers are in secured buildings. Gayte offers SSL encrypted access. Using SSL, the data exchange between your personal computer or mobile device and Gayte's server is protected to help prevent unauthorized parties from being able to intercept and read your data. SSL encryption is always activated. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your Credentials. Please note that emails, instant messages, and other means of correspondence are not necessarily encrypted. Gayte strongly advises you not to communicate any confidential information through emails, instant messages, or other means of correspondence and keep in mind that no platform, service, or method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. We work hard to keep evolving our security measures to keep up with the bad actors and other threats of the world to help protect your personal data.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>10. LIMITS OF RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNING THIRD PARTIES</b></p>
