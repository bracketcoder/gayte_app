                <p>Gayte provides the site(s), the app(s) and the other Service on an "as is", "with all faults" and "as available" basis. Gayte and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their officers, directors, employees, agents, partners and licensors (the "Gayte App Parties") disclaim all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express, implied or statutory, or arising from statute, course of dealing, usage of trade or otherwise, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, integration, interoperability or quiet enjoyment. The Gayte App Parties make no representations or warranties about the accuracy or completeness, currency, or non-infringement of the Service or of the information or other content contained in or accessible through the Service. The Gayte App Parties do not warrant that the functions of the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the Service or the servers that make the Service available will be free of viruses or other harmful components. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you.</p>
                <p>You understand and agree that you use the Service at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages that arise from such use. </p>
                <p>Under no circumstances shall the Gayte App Parties be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages of any kind, or any other damages whatsoever (however arising, including by negligence), including without limitation, damages related to use, misuse, reliance on, inability to use and interruption, suspension, or termination of any of the Service and damages resulting from loss of use or data, whether or not the Gayte App Parties have been advised of such possibility and regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable. Your only right with respect to any dissatisfaction with the Service shall be to terminate your use of the Service.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
                <p>You understand that your use of the Service may involve known and unanticipated risks that could result in injury or illness, including, but not limited to, dangers that may be caused by the acts or intentions of other users or other third parties (including without limitation, regarding any content (for example, inappropriate or explicit content) that you, another user or a third party posts, stores, shares, sends, transmits, disseminates, or receives through the Service), or occurrences beyond the control of the Gayte App Parties. By using the Service, you assume all such risks and dangers and all responsibility for any losses and/or damages. You voluntarily release, waive, discharge and hold harmless the Gayte App Parties from any and all claims, demands or causes of action for bodily injury, property damage, wrongful death, loss of Service or other claims that in any way arise from or are related to your use of the Service.

                <p>Gayte would not be able to provide the Service to you on an economically reasonable basis without these limitations and disclaimers.</p>

                <p><b>18. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAVER</b></p>
                <p>Any dispute or claim between You and Gayte must be settled by arbitration utilizing the dispute resolution procedures of United States rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. Gayte does not take part in dispute settlement procedures in front of a consumer arbitration entity for users residing in the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland.</p>
                <p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its then-applicable rules, including (as appropriate) its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at https://www.adr.org. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language by a single independent and neutral arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. Judgment on the arbitral award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>Before submitting a Claim to arbitration pursuant to this Section 18, you must first submit the Claim to Gayte for informal resolution through https://gayteapp.com. You and Gayte agree to work in good faith to resolve the Claim within sixty (90) days. If you and Gayte are unable to resolve the Claim informally within sixty (90) days, then we each may submit the Claim to arbitration.</p>
                <p>We each agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or your access to or use of the Service will be resolved only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you and Gayte may seek injunctive relief and any other equitable remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect our intellectual property rights, whether in aid of, pending or independently of the resolution of any dispute pursuant to the arbitration procedures set forth above.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>19. INFORMATION OR COMPLAINTS</b></p>

The failure of any party at any time to require performance of any provision of these Terms shall in no manner affect such party's right at a later time to enforce the same. A waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the same or other provisions of these Terms.</p>
                <p>These Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties here to and their respective successors and permitted assigns. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to another party without the express written consent of Gayte.</p>

The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.</p>

                <p>You and Gayte agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. otherwise, such cause of action shall be permanently barred.</p>
